# README Generator

## Description 

The README is probably one of the most important part to a application from a developer point of veiw. In order for other developers to jump in a contribute or 
even help debug the application they first have to understand the why and how the application runs. This includes the functionality as well as any third party programs
that may be required in order to run the application, such a node.js and inquirer. The README is just as important to understanding the application as comments are
to understanding a peice of code. Thus this application was created in order to aid developers in creating a detailed, professional, and understandable README.

This back end application uses node.js to generator a README file using inquirer. This takes in the users response using inquirer and creates a professional level README.

## Installation

For this program you will need node.js installed on to you computer, as well as have inquirer installed into your working directory. 


## Usage 

In order to run the application you will have to be in the same directory as index.js. From there you type in node index.js in order to trigger the first prompt.
From there you just answer the questions as they come (you may skip certain ones if you do not wish to answer) and when you are done a README.md file will be 
created in the develop directory. From here you can open in up in vscode or as a preveiw to veiw the whole thing as it would appear on github.

Here is a video that demonstrates the functionality [video](./Develop/assets/video/README-tutorial)
